### ~ ABOUT ME ~
My goal is to become a front-end developer and receive a job offer.
I chose this direction because I like finding solutions to complex problems, constantly developing, seeing the results of my work and generally enjoying it. Qualities such as perseverance, meticulousness and attentiveness help me to master this profession.

I took part in several internships (Edavoz.by, ZNS) at Startups, so I have experience working in a team.

In addition to my knowledge base, I actively seek out new technologies and try to stay up-to-date on industry trends and advancements. I am open to learning new information. My professional interests I would preferably learn are JavaScript technologies (s/a Angular, React, Node.js).
